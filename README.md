# Quantum Machine Learning for Time Series Classification using Topological Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the materials and code related to my Masterâ€™s thesis. My research focuses on exploring **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** techniques for classifying time series data generated by **fractional Brownian motion (fBm)**. The main contributions of my thesis include:

- Studying quantum circuits and their use in quantum algorithms.
- Implementing quantum algorithms, including **Groverâ€™s algorithm** via quantum circuits to solve problems such as bipartite graph analysis.
- Exploring the field of **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** and its differences from classical machine learning.
- Applying **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** techniques for extracting robust features from time series data.
- Designing a quantum classification model for time series classification based on extracted topological features.

## Main Work Summary

Matrix algebra, along with the symmetric and anti-symmetric nature of the wave function of multi-particle systems, has led to a new approach alongside classical physics, namely quantum mechanics. Inspired by the proposed approaches in quantum computing and the efforts to build quantum computers, new algorithms for optimization and solving complex problems have been developed.

In this thesis, I leveraged the **self-similarity** property of a global class of time series modeled based on **fractional Brownian motion (fBm)**, which is characterized by the Hurst exponent. My goal was to use **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** derived from algebraic topologyâ€”known for its robustness to noise and trendsâ€”in the field of **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** for classifying fBm time series.

Specifically:

- I generated **200 fractional Brownian motion time series** across ten classes of Hurst exponents, \( H \in [0,1] \) with step size \( \Delta H = 0.1 \).
- 75% of the data was used for training, and 25% for testing.
- From each time series, I extracted **seven topological features** using persistent homology:

- These features were embedded into quantum states via a **quantum domain embedding** method.
- I constructed a **six-layer quantum circuit** using rotation gates with trainable parameters and controlled gates to create entanglement. The model (VQC) was designed for multi-class classification across the ten Hurst exponent classes.

- The cost function was defined as the square of the expectation value of the Pauli-Z operator, capturing the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements.
- I optimized the quantum model using the **Adam optimizer**.
- The best classification accuracy achieved was **87%**, independent of the values of the Hurst exponent.
